        At Egmont, we inspire children to become proud readers through our diverse portfolio of inclusive, child-friendly books and magazines.
      </h2>
<p>Egmont is the largest specialist children’s book publisher in the UK, and our publications reach around one million children a month.
<p>Egmont’s publications stretch imaginations for the next generation and help little ones to learn about life. Our books take children on adventures through magical lands, help them deal with big emotions, encourage them to empathise and identify with other people, inspire them to learn new things, and help them bond with family and friends.</p>
<p>Our market-leading analysis, understanding of trends, and close research with schools and families mean that we know what children love, and know how to encourage a love of reading in kids of all ages.</p>

<p>We encourage ‘reading through stealth’ and understand that all reading is good reading. With activity books, guides for popular games, film tie-in novels and encyclopaedias, and magazines about contemporary culture and brands, we promote reading through play and turn even the most reluctant readers into passionate ones.</p>
<p>We are a publisher of firsts, with a commitment to inclusivity, ethical publishing standards and an investment in debut talent.</p>
<p>Egmont is a unique children’s publisher. We’re part of a large media group with headquarters in Copenhagen and we’re owned by a charitable foundation. The Egmont Group have donated over €350 million to children’s charities since 1920 and reinvested the remainder of our profits in the business.</p>
